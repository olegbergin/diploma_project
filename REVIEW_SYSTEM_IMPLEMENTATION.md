# Review System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides a complete implementation guide for the comprehensive review system that has been added to your diploma project. The system allows customers to review completed appointments, businesses to respond, and administrators to moderate content.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### Apply Database Extensions
Before running the application, you need to apply the database schema extensions:

```sql
-- Run the following SQL script in your MySQL database
-- File: backend/database/review_system_extensions.sql

-- 1. Add missing columns to existing reviews table
ALTER TABLE reviews 
ADD COLUMN appointment_id INT(11) AFTER business_id,
ADD COLUMN business_response TEXT AFTER text,
ADD COLUMN response_date TIMESTAMP NULL AFTER business_response,
ADD COLUMN is_hidden BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE AFTER response_date,
ADD COLUMN hidden_reason VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER is_hidden,
ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AFTER created_at;

-- 2. Create complaints table for review reports
CREATE TABLE review_complaints (
  complaint_id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  review_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
  reporter_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
  complaint_type ENUM('inappropriate', 'fake', 'offensive', 'spam', 'other') NOT NULL,
  complaint_text TEXT,
  status ENUM('pending', 'reviewed', 'resolved', 'dismissed') DEFAULT 'pending',
  admin_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (review_id) REFERENCES reviews(review_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (reporter_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Run the complete script from backend/database/review_system_extensions.sql
```
